## Project Analysis - Information Architecture

The website has a **single-page layout**, divided into clear sections that users can easily access through the navigation bar at the top.  
When a visitor clicks on a menu option, the page scrolls smoothly to the selected section, making navigation simple and intuitive.  
The information is organized in a logical way to guide the user from personal introduction to professional details.  

The first part, **About Me**, gives an overview of me as a person. It describes my personality, motivation, and main interests, helping the reader quickly understand who I am.  
Then, the **Education** section lists my studies, starting from secondary school to my current Bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering. It shows my academic progress and interest in technology.  

The next section, **Skills**, is divided into two categories. The first one, *Technical Skills*, presents my programming knowledge, basic AI understanding, and 3D design abilities. The second one, *Soft Skills*, highlights my teamwork, empathy, and organization skills. This division helps the visitor clearly see both my technical and personal strengths.  

The **Experience** section includes a list of my previous jobs, each with a short explanation of my responsibilities and what I learned. This section shows that I already have real work experience in different areas.  

Finally, the **Contact** section offers my phone number, email address, and location, making it easy for visitors to reach me.  

The structure follows a natural and professional flow: from personal introduction, to education, skills, experience, and contact information. The page uses similar spacing, color tones, and smooth scrolling to create an easy reading experience.  
Each section is well separated but visually connected, making the whole website consistent and pleasant to explore.  
This simple and logical organization helps users find what they need quickly and understand my background at a glance.

## Project Analysis - Visual Design

The visual design focuses on **simplicity, clarity, and professionalism**.  
The main objective was to create a modern and visually attractive page that reflects my personality and skills as a young developer. The design uses colors, shapes, and typography to communicate a sense of order, confidence, and creativity without being too complex.  

The color palette is mainly composed of different shades of blue (#E7FAFF, #B8EAFF, #CAE7FF), combined with a dark blue (#00315A) for headings and important text. Blue tones are often used in technology and business because they represent reliability, intelligence, and trust. The mix of light and dark blues helps separate different areas of the page and makes the text easier to read.  

The **typography** chosen is *Inter*, a modern and simple font that is easy to read on any screen. It gives the website a professional and friendly look. The use of bold text for titles and normal weight for paragraphs helps create visual hierarchy and makes the information more organized.  

The layout follows a **two-column structure** in the top section, with text on the left and a personal photo on the right. A diagonal blue shape in the background adds depth and dynamism to the header, making it visually interesting. Other sections are centered and evenly spaced to maintain balance.  

Rounded corners, soft shadows, and smooth buttons make the website look modern and clean. The repetition of similar elements, such as margins and colors, creates a sense of unity. Each part of the page feels connected and consistent, giving the user a pleasant and professional browsing experience.  
Overall, the design helps to reflect my technical background while keeping the website elegant and easy to use.
