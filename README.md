## Project Analysis – Visual Design

The visual design aims to combine **simplicity, professionalism, and clarity**.  
The chosen **color palette** uses different shades of blue (#E7FAFF, #B8EAFF, #CAE7FF) to create a calm, trustworthy, and modern atmosphere. This colors are often associated with technology and reliability.  
The **dark blue** (#00315A) used for titles contrasts well with the light background, highlighting important information such as name and section headings.  

The **typography** selected is *Inter*, a clean and highly legible font, suitable for digital interfaces. It is professional while maintaining a friendly and approachable tone.  

The page follows a **two column hero section** (text on the left, image on the right) with a dynamic diagonal background shape that adds visual interest and depth.  
Rounded buttons and soft shadows give the interface a modern feel, while maintaining simplicity.  
Consistency in spacing, alignment, and color ensures readability and aesthetic coherence across all sections.
